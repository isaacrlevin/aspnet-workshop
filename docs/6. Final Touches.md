# Final Touches

## Adding EF Healthchecks to the BackEnd

1. Add a reference to the NuGet package `Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.EntityFrameworkCore`.

    > This can be done from the command line using `dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.EntityFrameworkCore`

1. Add a DbContext health check in `Program.cs` by adding the following code to to the list of services, after the database is configured:

   ```csharp
   builder.Services.AddHealthChecks()
      .AddDbContextCheck<ApplicationDbContext>();
   ```

1. Wire up health checks by modifying the `WebApplication` in `Program.cs` with `app.MapHealthChecks("/health");`. This will configure the health checks on the `/health` end point.
1. Test the end point by navigating to `/health`, it should return the text `Healthy`.

## Adding EF Healthchecks to the FrontEnd

1. Add a reference to the NuGet package `Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.EntityFrameworkCore`.
    > This can be done from the command line using `dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.EntityFrameworkCore`
1. Add a DbContext health check in `Program.cs` by adding the following code to to the list of services, after the database is configured:

   ```csharp
   builder.Services.AddHealthChecks()
      .AddDbContextCheck<IdentityDbContext>();
   ```

1. Wire up health checks by modifying the `WebApplication` in `Program.cs` with `app.MapHealthChecks("/health");`. This will configure the health checks on the `/health` end point.
1. Test the end point by navigating to `/health`, it should return the text `Healthy`.

## Adding a custom health check to test for BackEnd availability

1. Add a `CheckHealthAsync` method to `IApiClient`.

   ```c#
   public interface IApiClient
   {
       ...
       Task<bool> CheckHealthAsync();
   }
   ```

1. Implement the `CheckHealthAsync` method in `ApiClient` by adding the following code:

    ```csharp
    public async Task<bool> CheckHealthAsync()
    {
        try
        {
            var response = await _httpClient.GetStringAsync("/health");

            return string.Equals(response, "Healthy", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase);
        }
        catch
        {
            return false;
        }
    }
    ```

1. Create a `HealthChecks` folder under the root folder in the FrontEnd project.
1. Create a file called `BackendHealthCheck.cs` with the following implementation:

    ```csharp
    using System;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using System.Linq;
    using System.Threading;
    using System.Threading.Tasks;
    using FrontEnd.Services;
    using Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks;

    namespace FrontEnd.HealthChecks
    {
        public class BackendHealthCheck : IHealthCheck
        {
            private readonly IApiClient _client;

            public BackendHealthCheck(IApiClient client)
            {
                _client = client;
            }

            public async Task<HealthCheckResult> CheckHealthAsync(HealthCheckContext context, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default(CancellationToken))
            {
                if (await _client.CheckHealthAsync())
                {
                    return HealthCheckResult.Healthy();
                }

                return HealthCheckResult.Unhealthy();
            }
        }
    }
    ```

1. Register the `BackendHealthCheck` in `ConfigureServices`:

    ```csharp
    services.AddHealthChecks()
            .AddCheck<BackendHealthCheck>("backend")
            .AddDbContextCheck<IdentityDbContext>();
    ```

1. Test the end point by navigating to `/health`, it should return the text `Healthy`.

## Fix Rendering Issues with Blazor

You may have noted that for some pages/components that the `OnInitializedAsync` handler fires twice when the page is called. One example is loading the `Agenda.razor` component that is used in the `Home.razor` component as well as the `MyAgenda.razor` component. This is due to the fact that rendering for Blazor can occur a few ways depending on HOW you want the app to render. In our app, we are rendering by default `InteractiveServerMode` which enables interactive Server-Side rendering. This is great because it makes sure your app is crawable, which is a known issue with single-page type applications like Angular,Vue or React. THe problem here is that prerendering components in this case means that when you are interacting with external data (an Api call for instance), the data will get fetched twice, once each render. We can work-around that because Blazor starting .NET 8 supports being able to configure render modes at the component level. We can do that by adding/updating the `@rendermode` directive on the component to this:

```html
@rendermode @(new InteractiveServerRenderMode(false))
```

What this does is tell Blazor to NOT prerender this component, so data will only load once. We will add this directive to `Agenda.razor`, `Session.razor` and `Search.razor` components.

To learn more about render modes in Blazor, take a look at the [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/components/render-modes)

## Implementing AppState

### Setting it up

One thing that you might have noticed as we went through this workshop is we have a fair amount of code duplication across our components. For instance getting `AuthenticationState`. We have code that looks like this in a few places.

```csharp
if (authenticationState is not null)
{
   var authState = await authenticationState;
   var authStateUser = authState?.User;

   if (authStateUser is not null)
   {
       if (authStateUser.Identity is not null && authStateUser.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
       {
           var user = await UserManager.FindByNameAsync(authStateUser.Identity.Name);
           if (user is not null)
           {
               IsAdmin = user.IsAdmin;
           }
       }
   }
}
```

We can do better. Let's implement a common pattern in Blazor where we persist application state throughout all the components.

1. In the `Services` folder, create a new class called `AppState.cs` and add the following code:

    ```csharp
   namespace FrontEnd.Services
   {
       public class AppState
       {
           public event Action OnChange;
           private void NotifyStateChanged() => OnChange?.Invoke();
       }
   }
    ```

    What is done above is add an `OnChange` property to the class that will tell the the applicaiton to sync the renderer with the value of `AppState`. This pattern is defined more in the [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/state-management?pivots=server#in-memory-state-container-service).

    > **Note** this is just one approach to persisting state. If it does not meet all at your needs, look at other options.

2. Next we need to register an instance of `AppState` for dependency injection so we can use in our components. Update `Program.cs` with the following line:

    ```csharp
    builder.Services.AddSingleton<AppState>();
    ```

### Replacing user data with App State

Now we can add methods and properties to `AppState` to store often accessed data in our app. Let's start with the user `AuthenticationState`. We don't need to store the entire state (we could if we wanted to) but instead need to store things like if the user is logged in, if they are an Admin or just an attendee and so on.

1. Add the following code to `AppState` to persist that data.

    ```csharp
     public string UserName { get; set; }

     public bool IsAdmin { get; set; }

     public bool IsAttendee { get; set; }

     public bool IsLoggedIn => !string.IsNullOrEmpty(UserName);

     public void SetUserName(string name)
     {
         if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(name))
         {
             UserName = name;
             NotifyStateChanged();
         }
     }

     public void SetIsAdmin(bool admin)
     {
         IsAdmin = admin;
         NotifyStateChanged();
     }

     public void SetIsAttendee(bool attendee)
     {
         IsAttendee = attendee;
         NotifyStateChanged();
     }
    ```

2. Here we simply have properties to store the values we want to persist and methods to set them. We can now start to `@inject` `AppState` into our components to do just. We know that the `Home.razor` component is the first component that is loaded so we could do something like this

    ```csharp
    @inject AppState AppState
    ...
    @code
    ...
    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
      if (authenticationState is not null)
      {
         var authState = await authenticationState;
         var authStateUser = authState?.User;

         if (authStateUser is not null)
         {
             if (authStateUser.Identity is not null && authStateUser.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
             {
                 var user = await UserManager.FindByNameAsync(authStateUser.Identity.Name);
                 if (user is not null)
                 {
                     AppState.SetUserName(user.UserName);
                     AppState.SetIsLoggedIn(true);
                     if (user.IsAttendee)
                     {
                         AppState.SetIsAttendee(true);
                     }

                     UserSessions = await ApiClient.GetSessionsByAttendeeAsync(UserName);
                 }
             }
         }
      }
      ...
    ```

    And going forward we would just reference the values from `AppState` when referencing in this component as well as other components. But this could be better!

3. One comment regarding above, it works, but is it really the best place to be setting server-side data (data regarding users is stored in `HttpContext` after all) in a component? A more interesting approach is setting the data in `AppState` on the server via Middleware. We are already checking if the user is logged in as well as an attendee in the `RequireLoginMiddleware.cs` class, we could set `AppState there like this.

    ```csharp
    public class RequireLoginMiddleware
    {
        private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

        private readonly AppState _appState;

        public RequireLoginMiddleware(RequestDelegate next, AppState appState)
        {
            _next = next;
            _appState = appState;
        }

        public async Task Invoke(HttpContext context)
        {
            var endpoint = context.GetEndpoint();

            // If the user is authenticated but not a known attendee *and* we've not marked this page
            // to skip attendee welcome, then redirect to the Welcome page
            if (context.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated &&
                endpoint?.Metadata.GetMetadata<SkipWelcomeAttribute>() == null)
            {
                var user = context.User;

                var isAttendee = user.IsAttendee();

                _appState.SetIsAdmin(user.IsAdmin());
                _appState.SetIsAttendee(isAttendee);
                _appState.SetUserName(user.Identity.Name);

                if (!isAttendee)
                {
                    _appState.IsAttendee = false;
                    context.Response.Redirect("/Welcome");

                    return;
                }
            }
            else
            {
                _appState.SetIsAdmin(false);
                _appState.SetIsAttendee(false);
                _appState.SetUserName(null);
            }

            await _next(context);
        }
    }
    ```

    What we did above use constructor injection to get an instance of `AppState` in our middleware and set the values of `IsAdmin`, `IsAttendee` and `UserName` based on the values from `HttpContext`. This way we will always know the values are accurate and we don't have to worry about handling changes when the user logs in or out.

4. We now can remove some code that is no longer needed from `Agenda.razor`, `EditSession.razor`, `Session.razor`, and `Welcome.razor`. Every component will need to be a little different, but should all follow a pattern like this:

    ```csharp
    ...
    @inject AppState AppState
    ...
    @code {
        ...
        protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
        {
            if (!AppState.IsAdmin)
            {
                NavigationManager.NavigateTo("/");
            }
        ...
    ```

    The simplest way to go through this part is to comment out all the `authenticationState` parameters on the component:

    ```csharp
    //[CascadingParameter]
    //private Task<AuthenticationState>? authenticationState { get; set; }
    ```
    And see what compilation errors show up. Than go through and replace all the properties that were used to store `IsAdmin`, `IsAttendee`, etc with calls to `AppState.IsAdmin` and so forth.

5. After you are done, you should be able to run your application and everything should work as it did before, except now more efficient.

### Persisting data from the Api in App State

Another are we can improve in our app is when we make calls to the Api. We make calls like this often when we probably do not need to:

```csharp
AllSessions = await ApiClient.GetSessionsAsync();
```

We could use some form of caching to persist this data either in-memory or in an external caching system like Redis, but we could also just persist that data in `AppState`.

1. Let's add some more properties and methods to `AppState`:

    ```csharp
    public List<SessionResponse> AllSessions { get; set; } = new List<SessionResponse>();

    public void SetAllSessions(List<SessionResponse> sessions)
    {
        AllSessions = sessions;
        NotifyStateChanged();
    }

    public List<SessionResponse> UserSessions { get; set; } = new List<SessionResponse>();

    public void SetUserSessions(List<SessionResponse> sessions)
    {
        UserSessions = sessions;
        NotifyStateChanged();
    }
    ```
    Now we have the ability to store/access both all the sessions in the database as well as sessions the user has added to their agenda.

2. We can now update components like `Agenda.razor` to set and retrieve session data from `AppState`:

    ```csharp
    ...
    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        if (AppState.AllSessions == null || AppState.AllSessions.Count == 0)
        {
            AppState.SetAllSessions(await ApiClient.GetSessionsAsync());
        }

        if (AppState.IsAttendee)
        {
            //Attendee
            AppState.SetUserSessions(await ApiClient.GetSessionsByAttendeeAsync(AppState.UserName));
            userSessionIds = AppState.UserSessions.Select(u => u.Id).ToList();
        }

        if (GetMyAgenda)
        {
            sessions = AppState.UserSessions;
        }
        else
        {
            sessions = AppState.AllSessions!;
        }
    ...
    ```
3. We will also need to update `AddSessionToUser` and `RemoveSessionFromUser` to use sessions from `AppState`. Let's add methods in `AppState` to handle this:

    ```csharp
     public void AddSessionToUser(int sessionId)
     {
         UserSessions.Add(AllSessions.Where(a => a.Id == sessionId).FirstOrDefault());
         NotifyStateChanged();
     }

     public void RemoveSessionFromUser(int sessionId)
     {
         UserSessions.Remove(UserSessions.Where(a => a.Id == sessionId).FirstOrDefault());
         NotifyStateChanged();
     }
    ```
4. Now we can update those methods in `Agenda.razor` to use these new methods in `AppState`

    ```csharp
    private async Task AddSessionToUser(int SessionId)
    {
        await ApiClient.AddSessionToAttendeeAsync(AppState.UserName, SessionId);
        AppState.AddSessionToUser(SessionId);
        userSessionIds = AppState.UserSessions.Select(u => u.Id).ToList();
    }

    private async Task RemoveSessionFromUser(int SessionId)
    {
        await ApiClient.RemoveSessionFromAttendeeAsync(AppState.UserName, SessionId);
        AppState.RemoveSessionFromUser(SessionId);
        userSessionIds = AppState.UserSessions.Select(u => u.Id).ToList();
    }
    ```
    Now both `Home.razor` and `MyAgenda.razor` are leveraging `AppState` to get session data without making additional Api calls.

5. We will need to update the `Session.razor` and `EditSession.razor` components as well to use `AppState` instead of making a call to the Api. Remove instances where an unneeded Api call is occurring with calls to `AppState`.

6. Now we can build and run the app and confirm that all parts of the app still work as expected.

## Leveraging `_Imports.razor`

One common thing that happens as you build more and more components is that you may notice that you are `@using` the same namespaces or `@injecting` the same services over and over again. You can clean this up and leverage the `_Imports.razor` component that will contain all your directives that are used often. You don't have to put everything in here, just ones your consistently use throughout your app.

1. Go through components and add directives that are used multiple times to `_Imports.razor` and remove from individual components.

## Add A Better Loading Experience

One thing we can add as we wrap up our app is a better experience when the app is loading data from the Api. You might have seen while running that the UI on some pages (for instance `Agenda.razor`) flashes until it reaches it's final state. It would be great to have a loading notification on these components so there is no confusion to the user. Lucky for us, there is a rich ecosystem of Open Source components for Blazor so we can use one. My personal preference is from my friend Ed Charbeneau called [BlazorPro.SpinKit](https://github.com/EdCharbeneau/BlazorPro.Spinkit)

1. Add the `BlazorPro.Spinkit` package to our project using the dotnet cli
    ```bash
    dotnet add package BlazorPro.Spinkit
    ```
2. Add the following to your _Imports.razor
    ```html
    @using BlazorPro.Spinkit
    ```
3. Add the following line to the head tag of your `App.razor` component which is in the root of the `Components` folder.
   ```html
   <link href="_content/BlazorPro.Spinkit/spinkit.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
   ```
4. You can now add SpinKit to any component you like. For instance in `Agenda.razor`

    ```html
    <SpinLoader IsLoading="@(groupedSessions == null)" Center="true">
       <ContentTemplate>
           @if (dayOffsets != null)
           {
               <ul class="nav nav-pills mb-3">
                   @foreach (var day in dayOffsets)
                   {
                       <li role="presentation" class="nav-item">
                           <a style="cursor:pointer" class="nav-link @(CurrentDayOffset == day.Offset ? "active" : null)" @onclick="@(() => ChangeDate(day.Offset))">@day.DayofWeek?.ToString()</a>
                       </li>
                   }
               </ul>
           }

           @if (groupedSessions.Count() > 0)
           {
               <div class="agenda">
                   @foreach (var timeSlot in groupedSessions)
                   {
                       <h4>@timeSlot.Key?.ToString("HH:mm")</h4>
                       <div class="row">
                           @foreach (var session in timeSlot)
                           {
                               <div class="col-md-3 mb-4">
                                   <div class="card shadow session h-100">
                                       <div class="card-header">@session.Track?.Name</div>
                                       <div class="card-body">
                                           <h5 class="card-title"><a href="/Session/@session.Id">@session.Title</a></h5>
                                       </div>
                                       <div class="card-footer">
                                           <ul class="list-inline mb-0">
                                               @foreach (var speaker in session.Speakers)
                                               {
                                                   <li class="list-inline-item">
                                                       <a href="Speaker/@speaker.Id">@speaker.Name</a>
                                                   </li>
                                               }
                                           </ul>
                                           @if (AppState.IsLoggedIn)
                                           {
                                               <p class="mb-0">
                                                   @if (AppState.IsAdmin)

               if (GetMyAgenda)
               {
                   <h3>You Have Not Added Any Sessions to your agenda</h3>
               }
               else
               {
                   <h3>You Have Not Added Any Sessions to the database</h3>
               }
           }
       </ContentTemplate>
   </SpinLoader>
    ```
    Now the UI will show a loading indicator while the Api is returning data. Feel free to experiment with SpinKit to get the experience you want.
