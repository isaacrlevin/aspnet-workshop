# Containerization / Aspire

Now that we have a fully working conference management application, we can start to think about how this app would need to run when deployed to production. We can deploy both apps separately, but than we are responsible for handling how the Blazor app calls the Api (which honestly is a pain). One approach to reduce this complexity (and make your app run at a lesser cost) is to run your apps in containers. We could talk for an entire day about containers, so let's pretend we know enough about containers to be dangerous.

## Containerizing ASP.NET Core with Docker


## Using .NET Aspire to Containerize our App

As of May of 2024, the .NET team has made .NET Aspire generally available which means it can be run in production. .NET Aspire is an opinionated, cloud ready stack for building observable, production ready, distributed applications (that is from the [official docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/get-started/aspire-overview) ðŸ˜€). One of the biggest benefits to .NET Aspire is to simplify how we build applications that have multiple pieces and can be quite complex. Our app isn't very complicated, but if this was to run in the cloud we might want to add Aspire to make it more resilient.




### Add Aspire Support

1. Right-Click on the `BackEnd` project and choose `.NET Aspire Orchestrator Support`

2. Give a project name prefix and location

3. Two new projects will be created, `ConferencePlanner.AppHost` and `ConferencePlanner.ServiceDefaults`

4. Right-Click on the `FrontEnd` project and choose `.NET Aspire Orchestrator Support`. You will be asked if you want to add it to the same orchestration

    Now we have all the Aspire bits setup. Now we can setup our app to run with Aspire.
