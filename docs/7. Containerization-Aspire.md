# Containerization / Aspire

> **Note** To perform the steps in this part of the workshop, you will need Docker installed on your machine, as well as `docker compose`. If you can, it is highly recommended to install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

Now that we have a fully working conference management application, we can start to think about how this app would need to run when deployed to production. We can deploy both apps separately, but than we are responsible for handling how the Blazor app calls the Api (which honestly is a pain). One approach to reduce this complexity (and make your app run at a lesser cost) is to run your apps in containers. We could talk for an entire day about containers, so let's pretend we know enough about containers to be dangerous.

## Containerizing ASP.NET Core with Docker

One way to containerize your app is with Docker. Docker is pretty handy because the tooling for it with Visual Studio is quite good. Let's go through the process needed to configure our app to run in Docker.

1. Right-Click on the `BackEnd` project and choose `Container Orchestration Support`

2. Choose `Docker Compose` as the container orchestrator.

    ![Choosing Docker Compose](images/add-docker-support-2.png)

3. Choose `Linux` as the Target OS:

    ![Choosing Target OS](images/add-docker-support-3.png)

4. You will see a new project is created called `docker-compose` and a `Dockerfile` is added to your `BackEnd` project.

5. Complete the same steps for the `FrontEnd` project.

    Now we can start to update our app to run in containers.

6. In the `docker-compose` project, there is a file that is used by Visual Studio to configure the docker-compose call to build our containers. Update the contents of `docker-compose.override.yml` to the following:

    ```yml
   version: '3.4'

   services:
     backend:
       environment:
         - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
         - ASPNETCORE_HTTP_PORTS=8080
         - ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORTS=8081
       ports:
         - "5432:8080"
         - "5433:8081"
       volumes:
         - ${APPDATA}/Microsoft/UserSecrets:/home/app/.microsoft/usersecrets:ro
         - ${APPDATA}/ASP.NET/Https:/home/app/.aspnet/https:ro
       extra_hosts:
           - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
     frontend:
       environment:
         - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
         - ASPNETCORE_HTTP_PORTS=8080
         - ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORTS=8081
         - ServiceUrl=http://host.docker.internal:5432
       ports:
         - "5434:8080"
         - "5435:8081"
       volumes:
         - ${APPDATA}/Microsoft/UserSecrets:/home/app/.microsoft/usersecrets:ro
         - ${APPDATA}/ASP.NET/Https:/home/app/.aspnet/https:ro
       extra_hosts:
           - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
    ```

To allow our 2 different apps (which will be running in separate containers) to communicate, we perform some port mapping, set the host-gateway to `host.docker.internal` (this is to allow the FrontEnd container to reach the Backend). And update our `ServiceUrl` (which is stored in `appsettings.json` previously) environment variable to the `http` endpoint of the `BackEnd` project.

7. Notice that we are calling the Api over the http endpoint. To allow this, we will need to make a change to the `BackEnd` project to not force HttpsRedirection. Update the contents of `Program.cs` in the `BackEnd` project so the `app.UseHttpsRedirection()` extension is commented out:

   ```csharp
   //app.UseHttpsRedirection();
   ```

    We should now be able to run the `Docker Compose` project in Visual Studio and our containers will build and run and we will be able to validate our app now works running in containers.

## Using .NET Aspire to Containerize our App

You notice above that there were some steps that we had to do to allow our containers to talk to each other. Let's look at a different way to have our app run in containers without having to do this.

As of May of 2024, the .NET team has made .NET Aspire generally available which means it can be run in production. .NET Aspire is an opinionated, cloud ready stack for building observable, production ready, distributed applications (that is from the [official docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/get-started/aspire-overview) ðŸ˜€). One of the biggest benefits to .NET Aspire is to simplify how we build applications that have multiple pieces and can be quite complex. Our app isn't very complicated, but if this was to run in the cloud we might want to add Aspire to make it more resilient.

### Add Aspire Support

1. Right-Click on the `BackEnd` project and choose `.NET Aspire Orchestrator Support`

    ![Adding Aspire Support](images/add-dotnet-aspire-support.png)

2. Give a project name prefix and location

    ![Aspire Support Confirmation](images/add-dotnet-aspire-support-2.png)

3. Two new projects will be created, `ConferencePlanner.AppHost` and `ConferencePlanner.ServiceDefaults`

4. Right-Click on the `FrontEnd` project and choose `.NET Aspire Orchestrator Support`. You will be asked if you want to add it to the same orchestration

    ![Aspire Support Exists](images/add-dotnet-aspire-support-3.png)

    Now we have all the Aspire bits setup. Now we can setup our app to run with Aspire.

### Enable Service Discovery with Aspire

One huge benefit to .NET Aspire is allowing services to communicate with eachother without having to directly worry about the host name, ip address or port of the other service. In our case, we have to know the IP address of the backend from our frontend to make Api calls. With Aspire, we can add references in our `AppHost` to eliminate that.

1. Update `Program.cs` of the `ConferencePlanner.AppHost` project to look like this:

   ```csharp
      var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

      var backend = builder.AddProject<Projects.BackEnd>("backend");

      builder.AddProject<Projects.FrontEnd>("frontend")
          .WithReference(backend);

      builder.Build().Run();
     ```

   What this code is doing is creating an instance of our backend, and adding it as a reference to our FrontEnd. Now when we run the `AppHost` project, we will have both apps running and the frontend can call the backend.

1. We can validate this by removing the `ServiceUrl` settings from `appsettings.json` of the `FrontEnd` project and by changing the base address of our `HttpClient` in `Program.cs` to this:

   ```csharp
   builder.Services.AddHttpClient<IApiClient, ApiClient>(client =>
   {
      client.BaseAddress = new("https+http://backend");
   });
   ```
   Here we know that are backsend service is called `backend` and Aspire will wire up the proper mapping.

1. When you run the `AppHost` project, Aspire will run both your `BackEnd` and `FrontEnd` and also run the [Aspire Dashboard](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/dashboard/overview), which is a very handy UI to see all the logs and metrics of all your Aspire resources.

      ![Aspire Dashboard](images/aspire-dashboard.png)

  That is one really cool thing you can do with Aspire, but there is so much more! Let's look at something else.

### App Caching with Redis and .NET Aspire

You may remember that we implemented state management for our application to reduce calls to the Api/database. This is great if you have one user, but in most cases, you will have many users. It would be great if we could save parts of the application state across ALL USERS. Well Aspire can help with that too.

Aspire has built-in integration for Redis, which is a well-known mechanism to cache data across services. We can wire up a container that is running Redis and configure Aspire to use that cache.

1. Update the `Program.cs` of our `AppHost` project to look like below:

   ```csharp
   var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

   var redis = builder.AddRedis("cache");

   var backend = builder.AddProject<Projects.BackEnd>("backend");

   builder.AddProject<Projects.FrontEnd>("frontend")
    .WithReference(redis)
    .WithReference(backend);

   builder.Build().Run();
   ```

    Similar to what we did with adding a service reference, we create a redis resource and add it as a reference to our `FrontEnd` project.

1. Now we will setup OutputCaching on the front end of our application. Add a reference to the `Aspire.StackExchange.Redis.OutputCaching` Nuget package to your `FrontEnd`.

   ```bash
   dotnet add Aspire.StackExchange.Redis.OutputCaching
   ```

2. Add the following lines of code to your `Program.cs` of the `FrontEnd` project.

   ```csharp
   ...
   builder.AddRedisOutputCache("cache");
   ...
   app.UseOutputCache();
   ...
   ```

3. Add the `OututCache` `@attribute` directive to `Home.razor`

   ```html
   @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.OutputCaching
   @attribute [OutputCache(Duration = 5)]
     ```

This will setup caching on the `/` or `/Home` route for 5 seconds.

4. Comment out the `@rendermode` attribute from `Agenda.razor`

  ```html
  @* @rendermode @(new InteractiveServerRenderMode(false)) *@
  ```

  > **Note**: We are only quickly showing how you can cache in a very small scenario for our app. Some functionality will not work correctly after doing this, but it is the quickest way to show how to wire up caching.

5. Comment out calls to `AppState` in the `OnInitializedAsync` handler

  ```csharp
  // if (AppState.AllSessions == null || AppState.AllSessions.Count == 0)
  // {
  //     AppState.SetAllSessions(await ApiClient.GetSessionsAsync());
  // }

  if (AppState.IsAttendee)
  {
      //Attendee
      AppState.SetUserSessions(await ApiClient.GetSessionsByAttendeeAsync(AppState.UserName));
      userSessionIds = AppState.UserSessions.Select(u => u.Id).ToList();
  }

  if (GetMyAgenda)
  {
      sessions = AppState.UserSessions;
  }
  else
  {
      //sessions = AppState.AllSessions!;
      sessions = await ApiClient.GetSessionsAsync();
  }
  ```

6. Run `AppHost` project, navigate to the Traces area in the Aspire dashboard, choose `backend` from the dropdown and reload the home page a few times. You will see that not every time we reload the page we go back to the backend, showing that we are caching.

    Obviously we would have to make more modifications to our app to get caching working throughout, but this is a great start!

We could do so much more with Aspire, and I urge you to take a look at other ways we can make our app more resilient with it.
